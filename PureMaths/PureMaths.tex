\section{Lesson 1 - Logic: Statements and Truth}

\subsection{Overview}

This section introduces the notion of statements and truth tables.

\subsection{Statements with words}

\par
The goal of this section is to determine wether a sentence is a statement or not.\\

A statement or proposition is a sentence that can be true or false, but not both
simultaneously. If it expresses a single idea, we say it is an atomic statement.
If we want to create a statement with more than one idea, we need to connect the
atomic statement using logical connectives.

\subsection{Statements with symbols}

In mathematics, we want to express mathematical statement in symbols since they
actract away the unecessary clutter and help us focus on the form of the statement.
Consequently, we need to define a set of symbol used to define the common logical
connectives. The most common are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conjunction
    \item Disjunction
    \item Negation
    \item Implication
    \item Biconditional
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Truth Table}

\par
Each logical connective is associated to a truth table, which tell us the
truth value of a compound statement based on the truth value of the propositional
variables. Here is the truth table for the common logical connectives:\\

We can also use truth table to determine if two statement are equivalent. To do
so, we compare their truth table.

\section{Lesson 2 - Set Theory: Sets and Subsets}

\subsection{Overview}

This section introduce the notion of sets, subsets, union and intersection.


\subsection{Describing Sets}


\begin{definition}[Set]
A set is a collection of objects. The set can either be finite or infinite. We
can describe the set based on a common characteristic among the elements of the
set using the set builder notation. We write \(\{x|P(x)\}\), where P(x) is the common
characteristic.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Axiom of Extensionality]
Two sets are equivalent if they contain the same element, we write:
$$ \forall x(x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cardinality]
The cardinality of an element is the number of different element in the set. For
example, the set S={1,2,3} has the same cardinality as the set T={1,2,2,3}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Fence-Post Formula]
To count the number of integers in a set, we use the fence-post formula
$$ n - m + 1 $$
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Subsets}

\begin{definition}[Subset]
We say that A is a subset of B if every element of A is an element of B. We write
\( A \subseteq B\)
$$ \forall x(x \in A \rightarrow x \in B) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Every set A is a subset of itself
$$ \forall x(x \in A \rightarrow x \in A) $$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    The empty set is a subset of every set
    $$ \forall x(x \in \emptyset \rightarrow x \in A) $$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Transitivity of sets]
Let A, B, C be sets such that $$ A \subseteq B, B \subseteq C. Then, A \subseteq C $$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    There are \(2^n\) subsets in a set
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Unions and Intersections}

\begin{definition}[Union]
    The union of the sets A and B, written \(A \cup B\), is the set of elements that
    are in A or B (or both).
    $$ \forall x(x | x \in A \lor x \in B) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Intersection]
    The intersection of the sets A and B, written \(A \cap B\), is the set of
    elements that are in A and B simultaneously.
    $$ \forall x(x | x \in A \land x \in B) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    If A and B are sets, then \( A \subseteq A \cup B\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \(B \subseteq A \iff A \cup B = A\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \(B \subseteq A \iff A \cap B = B\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Reflexive]
    A relation R is reflexive if  $ \forall x(x R x) $
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Symmetric]
    A relation R is symmetric if $$\forall x \forall y(x R y \rightarrow y R x)$$
\end{definition}

\section{Lesson 3 - Abstract Algebra: Semigroups, Monoids and Groups}
\subsection{Overview}

This section focus on the properties of semigroups, monoids and groups. It gives
us an intuition on why some set behave a certain way while other don't.

To determine wether a set has certain properties, we often use a multiplication
table.

\subsection{Binary Operations and Closure}

\begin{definition}[Binary Operation]
    A binary operation on a set is a rule that combines two elements of the set to
    produce another element of the set
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed]
    We say that the set S is closed under the partiel binary operation * if
    whenever \(a,b \in S\), we have \(a * b \in S \)
\end{definition}

\subsection{Semigroups and Associativity}

\begin{definition}[Associativity]
    Let * be a binary operation on a set. We say that * is associative in S if
    for all x, y, z in S, we have
    $$ x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z $$
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Semigroup]
    A semigroup is a pair (S,*), where S is a set and * is an associative binary
    opertaion on S
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
    If the binary operator * is not associative in S, then the pair (S,*) is not
    a semigroup
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Abelian or Commutative]
    Let * be a binary operation on a set. We say that * is abelian (or commutative)
    in S if for all x, y, z in S, we have
    $$ x * y = y * x $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Abelian Semigroup]
    An abelian semigroup is a semigroup that is commutative. Therefore, it has the
    following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Closed
	\item Associative
	\item Commutative
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Monoids and Identity}

\begin{definition}[Identity]
    Let (S,*) be a semigroup. An element e of S is called an identity with respect
    of the binary operation * if for all \( a \in S \), we have \( a * e = e * a = a \)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Monoid]
    A monoid is a semigroup with an identity. In other word, a monoid is
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Closed
	\item Associative
	\item Identity
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Unique Identity]
    Let (M, *) be a monoid with identity e. The identity element is unique
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Groups and Inverses}

\begin{definition}[Inverse]
    Let (M,*) be a monoid with identity e. An element a of M is called invertible
    if there is an element \( b \in M \) such that \( a * b = b * a = e \)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Group]
    A group is a monoid in which every element is invertible. Therefore, a group
    follows the following properties
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Closed
	\item Associative
	\item Identity
	\item Inversible
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Unique Inverse]
    Let (G, *) be a group. Each element in G has a unique inverse
\end{theorem}

\section{Lesson 4 - Number Theory: The Ring of Integers}

\subsection{Overview}

The goal of this section is to familiarise ourselves with induction proofs. However,
the proofs we have to prove utilize integers properties, so we have to define
ring properties first.

The notion of ring utilize the concepts of closure, associativity, abelian,
identity and inverses which we saw in the previous section.

\subsection{Ring and Distributivity}

    $ (\mathbb{Z} , \cdot) $ is a commutative monoid
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[Ring]
    A ring is a triple $ (R,+, \cdot) $ where R is a set, + and $ \cdot $ are binary
    operations on R that satisfies:
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item (R, +) is commutative group
	\item (R, $ \cdot $) is a commutative monoid
	\item Multiplication is distributive over addition in R. That is, for all
	    x,y,z $\in $ R, we have
	    $$ x \cdot (y+z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z \text{ and }
	    (y+z) \cdot x = y \cdot x + z \cdot x $$
    \end{enumerate}

    It should be noted that the properties that define a ring are called the ring axioms
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    $ (\mathbb{Z} , +, \cdot) $ is a commutative ring
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    $ (\mathbb{N} , +, \cdot) $ is a ring because $ (\mathbb{N} , +) $ is not a group.
    We say it is a semiring
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Divisibility}

\begin{definition}[Even]
    An integer a is called even if there is another integer b such that a = 2b
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Odd]
    An integer a is called odd if there is another integer b such that a = 2b + 1
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sum]
    We define the sum of integers a and b to be a + b
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Product]
    We define the product of integers a and b to be a $ \cdot $ b
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The sum of two even integer is even
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    The product of two integers that are each divisible by k is also divisible by k
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Induction}

\begin{definition}[Well Ordering Principle]
    The Well Ordering Principle says that every nonempty subset of natural numbers
    has a least element
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Principle of Mathematical Induction]
    Let S be a set of natural numbers such that
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item $ 0 \in S $
	\item $ \text{for all k } \in \mathbb{N} , k \in S \rightarrow k+1.
	    \text{ Then, } S= \mathbb{N} $
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}[Standard Advanced Calculus Trick]
    We can add and substract the same quantities without changing the result
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Intervals of Real Numbers}

\begin{definition}[Interval]
    A set I of real numbers is called an interval id any real number that lies
    between two numbers in I is also in I. We write:
    $$ \forall x, y \in I, \forall z \in \mathbb{R}, \text{if x is less than z
    and z is less than y, the z is in I} $$

    Here is a list of the other types of intervals:

\section{Lesson 7 - Complex Analysis: The Field of Complex Numbers}
\subsection{Overview}

We should alway keep in mind wether we are in a field or ring when working with
linear and quadratic equation.

\subsection{A Limitation of the Reals}

\begin{definition}[Linear Equation]
    A linear equation has the form ax+b=0.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quadratic Equation]
    A quadratic equation has the form $a^2 + bx + c =0 $, where $a \neq 0$
\end{definition}

\subsection{The Complex Field}

\begin{definition}[Standard From of a Complex Number]
    The standard form of a complex number is a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.
    The set of complex number is $\mathbb{C} = {a + bi | a,b \in \mathbb{R}}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[The Complex Plane]
    We can visualize a complex number as a point in the Complex Plane, which has
    a real axis (in x) and an imaginary axis (in y). The point (0,0) is called
    the origin\\

    The Complex plane allow us to visualize a complex number as a vector. If
    z is a complex number such as z=a+bi, we call a the real part of z and b the
    imaginary part of z. We write a = Re z and b = Im z
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Equality]
    Two complex numbers are equal if and only if they have the same real and
    imaginary part.
    % $$ a + bi = c + di \iif a = c \text{ and } b = d $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Addition]
    We can add two complex numbers by adding their real and imaginary parts.
    $$ (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d) i$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Substraction]
    We can find the difference of two complex numbers by substracting their real
    and imaginary parts.
    $$ (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d) i$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Division]
    Let z and w be complex numbers such that $z \in \mathbb{C}$ and
    $w \in \mathbb{C}*$. We define the quotient $\frac{z}{w}$ by
    % $$ \frac{z}{w} = z w^-1 = (a+bi) (\frac{c}{c^2 + d^2} - \fract{d}{(c^2 + d^2)i}) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Conjugate]
    The conjugate of the complex number z=a+bi is the complex number
    $\overline{z} = a - bi $
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Real Number]
    Let z be a complex number such that z=a+bi. If b=0, then we call z a real
    number.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Pure Imaginary Number]
    Let z be a complex number such that z=a+bi. If a=0, then we call z a pure
    imaginary number
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    $i^2 = -1$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    $ (\mathbb{C}, +, \cdot)$ is a field
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    $ (\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$ is a subfield of $ (\mathbb{C}, +, \cdot)$
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
    The field of complex numbers cannot be ordered
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Absolute Value and Distance}

\begin{definition}[Square Root]
    If x and y are real or complex numbers such that $y=x^2$, the we call x a
    sqaure root of y. If x is a positive real number, then we say that x is the
    positive square root of y and we write $x=\sqrt(y)$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Modulus of a Complex Number]
    The absolute value or the modulus of the complex number z=a+bi is the nonnegative
    real number $$ |z | = \sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = \sqrt((Re z)^2 + (Im z)^2) $$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Distance between Complex Numbers]
    The distance between the complex numbers z=a+bi and w=c+di is
    $$ d(z,w) = |z-w| = \sqrt((c-a)^2 + (d-b)^2)$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[The Triangle Inequality]
    For all $z,w \in \mathbb{C}, |z+w| \leq |z| + |w| $
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Basic Topology of $\mathbb{C}$}

\begin{definition}[Circle]
    A circle in the Complex Plane is the set of all points that are at a fixed
    distance from a fixed point. The fixed distance is called the radius of the
    circle and the fixed point is called the center of the circle\\

    If a circle has radius of r>0 and center c=a+bi, then any point z=x+yi on the
    circle must satisfy $|z-c| = r$, or equivalently, $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Disk]
    An open disk in $\mathbb{C}$ consists of all the points in the interior of a
    circle. If a is the center of the open disk and r is the radius of the open
    disk, then any point z inside the disk satisfies $|z-a|<r$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[r-neighborhood of a]
    $ N_r(a) = {z \in \mathbb{C} | |z-a| < r} $ is also called the r-neighborhood of a.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Diameter]
    In $\mathbb{R}$, an r-neighborhood of a is the open interval $N_r(a)=(a-r, a+r)$
    The diameter of this interval is 2r
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closed Disk]
    A closed disk is the interior of a circle together with the circle itself
    (boundary included). If a is the center of the closed disk and r is the radius
    of the closed disk, the any point z inside the closed disk satisfies
    $ |z-a| \leq r $
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Punctured Open Disk]
    A punctured open sidk consists of all the points in the interior of a circle
    except for the center of the circle. If a is the center of the punctured open
    disk and r is the radius of the open disk, then any point z inside the
    punctured disk satifies $|z-a|<r$ and $z \neq a$\\

    Since $z \neq a$ is equivalent to $z-a \neq 0$, then it is also equivalent to
    $ |z-a| \neq 0$. Since |z-a| must be nonnegative, then $|z-a|>0$ or $ 0<|z-a|$.

    Therfore, a puncture open disk with center a and radius r consists of all
    points z that satisfy 0<|z-a|<r
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Deleted r-neighborhood of a]
    $N_{r}^{\odot}(a)=\{z|0<| z-a \mid<r\}$ is also called a deleted r-neighborhood
    of a
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Subset]
    A subset X of $\mathbb{C} $ is said to be open if for every complex number
    z $\in$ X, there is an open disk D with $z \in D$ and $D \subseteq X$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    A subset X of $\mathbb{C}$ is open if and only if for every complex number
    w $\in$ X, there is a positive real number d such that $N_d(w) \subseteq X$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Closed Subset]
    A subset X of $\mathbb{C}$ is said to be closed if the complement of X
    $\in \mathbb{C}$, noted $\mathbb{C} \ X$, is open

    The complement concist of all complex numbers not in X
\end{theorem}

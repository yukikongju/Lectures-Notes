# Lectures Notes

This repository is an attempt at compiling all the ressources I used to
learn Computer Science, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering concepts.

# What I am currently working on

- [ ] Graph Theory
- [ ] Differential Equations
- [ ] Processus Stochastique
- [ ] LeetCode

# How I like to learn

When learning a new subjects, I like to have a mind map of where the
subject I take fits in the whole field. Then, I search for classes
and book around that field so I can build my own curriculum.

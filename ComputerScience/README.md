# Courses in Computer Science

## Motivation

According to [ACM's Curricula Recommendations](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations), we can break down the field of computing
in the following categories:
- Computer Engineering
- Computer Science
- Cybersecurity
- Information Systems
- Information Technology
- Software Engineering
- Data Science

My goal is to first learn the core courses of computing, and then
learn the most importants concepts in the repsective field.

## How I learn Computer Science

I believe there are 3 levels of mastery for all the subject in computer
science:
1. Theoritical: understand how the concept work at a higher level
2. Practical: can apply the theoritical stuffs
3. Inter-Fields: Can understand and generalize theoritical concept to
   other fields.

My goal is to focus primarily on the first two level of mastery:
theoritical and practical. For the theoritical aspect, I will follow the
lecture courses. However, unlike with maths, one cannot only pick up
a book and be done with it. Therefore, I need to find some projects to
apply those theoritical knowledge.

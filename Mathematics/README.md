## [Motivation](#motivation)

There are two branches in mathematics: pure and applied. My goal would
be to be familiar with the concepts teached in an undergrad math majors.

## [How I learn Maths](#how-i-learn-maths)

Ideally, learning maths the self-taught way would be similar to what
my classes are at uni: 2 class on theory and 1 class on practice.

Unfortunately, most courses online don't offer the practice classes,
where a TA would correct the homework and explain their answers. However,
I still try to emulate that framework: I try to find a list of exercices
to do each week and try to solve them before looking at the answer.

I also like to make lecture reviews after each class, which help me retains
what I have learned.

## [Core Classes](#core-classes)

After watching [Aleph's how to learn pure maths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo-alw2q-BU&t=430s), [The Math Sorcerer's Learn Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTnEG_WGd2Q) , [Arongil Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapgPfFAgr4), [CHALK's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG7ZKdKTo6E&t=1220s), I figured the following Courses were essential to
understand maths:

1. Calculus: Diffential, Integral, Multivariable
3. Discrete Maths: Logic, Set Theory, Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Algorithms
4. Real Analysis
5. Linear Algebra
6. Topology
7. Differential Equations
8. Complex Analysis
9. Abstract Algebra
10. Differential Geometry
11. Probability

# Courses in Mathematics

## Motivation

There are two branches in mathematics: pure and applied. My goal would
be to be familiar with the concepts teached in an undergrad math majors.

## How I learn Maths

Ideally, learning maths the self-taught way would be similar to what
my classes are at uni: 2 class on theory and 1 class on practice.

Unfortunately, most courses online don't offer the practice classes,
where a TA would correct the homework and explain their answers. However,
I still try to emulate that framework: I try to find a list of exercices
to do each week and try to solve them before looking at the answer.

I also like to make lecture reviews after each class, which help me retains
what I have learned.

## Core Classes

After watching [Aleph's how to learn pure maths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo-alw2q-BU&t=430s), [The Math Sorcerer's Learn Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTnEG_WGd2Q) , [Arongil Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lapgPfFAgr4), [CHALK's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG7ZKdKTo6E&t=1220s), I figured the following Courses were essential to
understand maths:

1. Calculus: Calcul Différentiel, Calcul Intégral, Calcul à plusieurs variables
2. Discrete Maths: Logic, Set Theory, Combinatorics, Number Theory, Graph Theory
3. Real Analysis I,II: convergence, continuité, différentiation, integration
4. Linear Algebra
5. Topology
6. Differential Equations
7. Complex Analysis
8. Abstract Algebra
9. Differential Geometry
10. Probability

\section{Introduction}

The Study of Discrete Maths can be divided in a few sections:\\

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Logic and Quantifiers
	\item Set Theory
	\item Proofs
	\item Algorithms
	\item Number Theory and Cryptography
	\item Induction and Recursion
	\item Counting and Combinatorics
	\item Discrete Probability
	\item Functions and Relations
	\item Boolean Algebra
	\item Graph Theory and Trees
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Logic and Quantifiers}

\subsection{Why do we care about logic?}

Learning about logic is useful for several reasons. First of all, studying logic
is the backbone of all mathematical proofs done in advance maths. Furthermore,
logic can also be applied in other areas. For instance, in computer science, we
can use propositional logic to simplify digital circuits. In philosophy, we use
logic to make sound argument.

\subsection{Meta for Logic}

The chapter of logic is structured as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Define some definition/properties
	\item Translating Statement to Mathematical Statement using these symbols
	\item More Problems using these logical operators
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Propositional Logic}

The goal of this section is to determine wether a statement is true or false
using truth table or propositional logic.\\

We also want to translate sentence into a propositional statement or with its
quantifiers.

\subsubsection{What is a Statement?}

A statement is a proposition that can either be true or false, but not both.
It links propositional variables with logical operators. A statement can be
atomic or compound depending on the number of ideas it connects.

\subsubsection{Logical Operators}

As stated earlier, there are a few logical operators that can be used to link
propositional variables together. Each of these operators are associated with
a truth table that tells us the truth value of a proposition based on the value
of its propositional variables.\\

Here is a list of the logical Operators:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conjonction
    \item Disjunction (inclusive or)
    \item Exclusive Or
    \item Negation
    \item Implication
    \item Biconditional
\end{enumerate}

TODO: Add Truth Table for logical Operators

\subsubsection{Propositional Equivalence}

When we search for propositional equivalence, we want to determine wether or not
two or more statement have the same propositional value, regardless of the value
of the propositional variables. To determiner propositional equivalence, we use
truth table and determine if there is a tautology ie if both truth table are the
same.

\subsubsection{Translating Sentences into Propositional Statement}

\subsection{Quantifiers}

Another important concept in logic is quantifiers. Quantifiers tells us wether
a proposition holds true for all elements or some elements.\\

The most used quantifiers are the following:

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Universal Quantifier
	\item Existential Quantifier
	\item Uniqueness Quantifier
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Negating a quantifier}

\subsubsection{Translating Statement in Statement with Quantifiers}

\subsection{Inference}

The third concept in logic is the notion of inference. Using some premisses,
we want to determine wether a conclusion holds true or not using inference rules.

There are a few inference rules:

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Modus Ponens
	\item Modus Tollens
	\item Hypothetical Syllogism
	\item Disjunctive Syllogism
	\item Addition
	\item Simplification
	\item Conjunction
	\item Resolution
    \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Proofs Techniques}

When we want to prove a statement, there is a few proofs techniques we can use.
Depending on the structure of the theorems, we may want to use one method over
another.

Here is a list of the proofs techniques:

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Direct Proofs
	\item Contraposition
	\item Contradiction
	\item Induction
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{More Tips}

Althought most of the proofs follows the structure mentionned above, we can use
additional tricks to make our proofs a little easier

    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Exhaustive Proofs and Proofs by Cases
	\item Without Loss Of Generality
	\item Counter-Example
	\item Existence Proofs
    \end{enumerate}
